# Notes from Hyperparameter tunning of the class
high variances:
 - L2 regularisation: prevent overfitting. By assigning a high value to the lambda, the W matrix become very small thus elimiating that node
 - Dropout regularisation: at each layer set up the probability to remove some nodes in the layer
   - Inverted dropout 
   Intution: Cant rely on any one feature, so have to spread out weights
